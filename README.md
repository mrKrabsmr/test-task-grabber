Grabber app

run:
    python3 main.py (Linux)

can take need parse links in params with flag -l separated by commas:
    python3 main.py -l https://x,https://y,https://z (Linux)

without link params app parse all catalog of product pages 

.env file:
    - SHOPWARE_USERNAME
    - SHOPWARE PASSWORD

The task is very interesting, I liked solving it. The most difficult thing was to figure out the structure of data storage in shopware, but in general it also did not cause much inconvenience.
